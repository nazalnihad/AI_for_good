A farmer cannot solve these problems alone. However, Farmer Producer Organisations owned by large numbers of farmers can use their collective strength to solve these problems. Amul and Sahyadri Agro are a few examples of Farmer Producer Organisations who have proved that collectivisation of farming can create the eco-system necessary for farming to thrive. These models can and must be replicated on a massive scale. However, these models only work if they have a strong foundation and are built from the ground up. The gat is the first step which must be built and strengthened. This competition aims to motivate and train farmers in the process of collectivisation. It aims to start farmers on the journey from debt to prosperity.\n",

How does a gat handle differences? What is its vision? What is the quality of leadership?. All these factors contribute greatly to the success or failure of the gat. All gats that stand a chance of winning a prize in the competition on the basis of all the other heads above will be judged on this criteria by Paani Foundation judges appointed for this purpose. 10 Marks have been allocated under this section.\n",
